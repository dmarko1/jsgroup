JSKLA Group project

Welcome to our first try out for the group project. Though we havent decided yet on what to build, below are some few things to help you get started with.

Git Basics:
Github is used to help developers work on projects while keeping track of their changes. Its the best tool for version control.
To install it, if using MacOS or Ubuntu, it already comes installed and you can confirm it using git -v.
If on windows, click this https://git-scm.com/download/win and install, then confirm by using git -v.
Next is you confirm that you have an account on github already registered.
Send me your username my whatsapp and i will add you to the repository as a project collaborator.
What you mainly need to know about git.
- Several people can work on the same project but each person assigned with a different task or module.
- To get the base code from the repository, just git pull https://github.com/dmarko1/jsgroup.git and it will make for you a folder with the current code in it.
- Make your adjustments inside the code and whenever you have made some significant changes, git commit such that it saves them. A commit saves all you current adjustments into the folder you are using. It may ask you to add a commit message where you can add a small message of what you added in.
- When done, then you can push your code using the command 'git push master' such that your code merges with the main code.

Notes:
- Each person should work on a specific module such that the code doesnt get mixed up.

Goodluck everyone.
